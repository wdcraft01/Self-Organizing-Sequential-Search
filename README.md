# Self-Organizing Sequential Search #

The Self-Organizing Sequential Search project follows up some notes and class discussion from CS 533: Experimental Methods in Computer Science, from Spring 2019, taught by A. Mueen and G. M. Fricke, at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM.

## Getting Started ##

The project is written in MATLAB LiveScript and can be run directly from the MATLAB .mlx file, one section at a time.

## Running the Program: ... ##

The most straightforward startup process involves the following
sequence of steps ...

## Some Development Notes ##

<b>Thurs 5/16/2019</b>  1st Git Commit, establishing the method for sampling from a general Zipf distribution.

## Design & Design Issues ##

## Known Issues ##

No known issues at this time.

## Further Development ##

As of Thurs 5/16/2019, the rejection-based sampling method for sampling from a general Zipf distribution is working well, producing distributions of integers 1–n closely approximating the theoretical Zipf distribution (see the normalized frequency of elements formula available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).

Further development planned:

(1) [Simulation to Determine Average Cost for MTF Algorithm].

(2) [Simulation to Determine Average Cost for TR Algorithm].
